# PADJO 2017 can-viz visualization assignments




- [SFPD Incidents Involving Robberies or Narcotics](sfpd-robbers-drugs-incidents/)


## Instructions

For the given assignment, clickthrough to see a page listing screenshots of the visualizations that you and your classmates have turned in, numbered 1 through (however many people turned something in).

At the top of the page *should* be a Google Quiz. It simply asks you for your 3 favorite examples.

Don't vote for yourself. Your identity is known just to me.

### Evaluation guidelines

I'm not imposing any rules on what is a "good" visualization, so choose your favorites for your own reasons. If a visualization seems really important/smart but you just can't make sense of it and don't want to admit that for fear of looking dumb, then that viz probably isn't one of your favorites. Conversely, if a particular chart looks incredibly simple to the point of crudeness, but it conveys its important insight exactly as needed, then consider voting for it even if it won't win a beauty contest.
