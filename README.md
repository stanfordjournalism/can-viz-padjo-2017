# PADJO 2017 can-viz visualization assignments




- [SFPD Incidents Involving Robberies or Narcotics](sfpd-robbers-drugs-incidents/)


## Instructions

For the given assignment, clickthrough to see a page listing screenshots of the visualizations that you and your classmates have turned in, numbered 1 through (however many people turned something in).

At the top of the page *should* be a Google Quiz. It simply asks you for your 3 favorite examples.

Don't vote for yourself. Your identity is known just to me.
